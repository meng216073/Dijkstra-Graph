**For text file input use;**

`NodeName NodeName EdgeWeight` ex:    __london__ paris 10 -> _there is a directed edge from london to paris_

`NodeName NodeName EdgeWeight` ex:    __california__ london 20 -> _there is a directed edge from paris to london_
 
 
 
**To have undrected edges just write two lines with swapped nodes.**

__london__ paris 10

__paris__ london 10
